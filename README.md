# appointment_test

1. Only in memory. Database support was left out for simplicity
2. Alorithm was also kept simple. Dentist avalibility look up time is linear. Time complexity is O(N) where N is number of appointment intervals for a particular dentist.

3. Algorithm can be improved in logarithmic time using interval tree seach algorithm.
